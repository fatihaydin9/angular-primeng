In this repository, a simple application was developed using Angular 18, PrimeNG, and NodeJS. Efforts were made to learn Angular 18 components, service structure, TypeScript basics, and decorators. For the server side, a simple service named 'products' was created for simplicity and easy to use.

Client Address : http://localhost:4200
Server Address : http://localhost:3000
